We worked together on both algorithms (link-state and distance vectors) through vscode live-share. This way, we could work at the same time on the functions we had to implement. Each of us made contributions to the link_has_been_updated, process_incoming_routing_message, get_next_hop, and helper functions and we discussed our methodologies with each other for both algorithms.
